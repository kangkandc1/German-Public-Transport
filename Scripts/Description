Here we have the Juypter Ipython notebook that I used to carry out the Analysis for the state of Hessen.
#Some important points
1. Running this files requires that the following Python packages are installed: Geopandas, Numpy, Folium and Branca
2. Running this notebook requires the use of Bing Maps API Key. One can sign up for a basic key at [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key#creating-a-bing-maps-key)
3. Adapting the Notebook for another state requires change in the third block of code. This block corresponds to adding the city-districts to the data on cities/towns.
4. In the analysis, we only consider town with atleast 5 post offices. As a result, some thinly populated towns are not considere. Thats why the genereted map have data missing
for some regions. The reason for leaving out thinly populated towns is to reduce the number of API calls and focus on the towns/cities where a lot of people do actually live
