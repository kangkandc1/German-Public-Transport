# German-Public-Transport
##**Analysis of German Public Transport Usability-Background**
This project deals with the Analysis of the trade-offs that consumers in Germany face when choosing between using public transport, often referred to ÖPNV in Germany, and choosing to use their own car.
The last decade has seen an enhanced emphasis on promoting ÖPNV (Public Transport) as a step towards reducing the carbon footprint associated with the transportation sector. However, at the level of the individual consumer using ÖPNV as opposed to a personal vehicle, comes with some concrete challenges:


The inflexibility associated with depending on ÖPNV, especially at night.

The higher costs associated with long-distance ÖPNV travel.

Unpredictable delays, especially in long-distance ÖPNV travel.

Longer travel time associated with ÖPNV within the city/town.

Relative inaccessibility of destinations that do not lie within the city boundaries with ÖPNV.  

In this Application, we are trying to quantify  the problem arising out of longer travel while using public transit in the different states of Germany. I have completed analysis for 4 states so far. Collarborators are welcome to work on the other states of Germany so that we can cover the whole of the country.
